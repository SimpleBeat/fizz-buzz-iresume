        <h4>Hi, my name is Ilya!</h4>
        <p>I am...</p>

            <ul>
                <li>a Storyteller.
                    <p>My current daytime job is Storyteller at <i>The Anglo-American School of Moscow</i>. What does a storyteller do? Tells stories, of course! I am a visual storyteller, which means I use photography and videography to tell the world about the school, students, teachers, families, staff, leadership, and events. I take lots of pictures, film and edit numerous interviews and clips, and put it on the school's website and social media channels.</p>

                <li>an Actor.
                    <p>Before joining <i>The Anglo-American School of Moscow</i> I was an actor at an independent theatre called 'Albatross'. This was a cozy little space with about 60 people to sit. The plays were very much interactive, with actors speaking to the public, asking their opinion all the while acting out a story. I've been an actor for 15+ years, starting with the very simple short roles, growing slowly, and achieving mastery eventually to take on the lead parts in most plays. In the summer of 2020 the theatre had to close due to the pandemic, and my acting career has abruptly ended.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>a Web Developer.
                    <p>Ever since I remember my early school years, I've been crazy about computers. I liked playing games, of course, like most of the children of my age at the time, yet, unlike other kids I also liked to program a computer. I've taught myself BASIC at around 8, and wrote my very first program shortly after when my parents bought me a cheap computer, a knock-off of Spectrum ZX. To my delight, the program did work, and since it was a simple 'Guess the number' game, I could actually play with it!</p>
                    <p>Later on I started making websites, helping my friends with technical aspects of coding, and even though this has never become my day-time career, I utilized my knowledge at every opportunity I had: I've coded a web page for the <i>FLEX</i> organization with the alumni's thank you letters; I've developed and published first-ever online presence for the Acting Arts Institute when I studied acting there; I've reimplemented our theatre's web portal from scratch, attracting lots of new customers, and increasing the theatre's revenue 5-6 times; I've programmed and published a light website for a local spiritual leader...</p>

            <ul>
                <li>an iOS Developer.
                    <p>The first iOS device I had was an iPod Touch. I remember purchasing it at the local store, opening it up, charging and syncing it to the library of my music. It felt magical. From the very first day of using it I was looking for ways to code for it. I've got iPhone 3G later, and when the Developer SDK became available, I dove right in!</p>
                    <p>Just like with programming in general, coding for iPhone has always been my hobby. I made several apps over the course of my life so far. One used a camera of iPhone 4s to detect faces in the audience who were watching the show (looking directly at the stage, as opposed to the side or elsewhere). The app recorded that number every 5 seconds, and by the end of the show I had a graph of numbers showing where people were looking during various scenes. This information helped actors and directors tweak the performance, so that a weak scene (where few people were looking at the stage) could be enhanced, or played differently.</p>
                    <p>I am still very much into iOS coding. I create little games for my little daughter (Find the Corgi was her long-time favorite), I create helper apps for my work, and think about publishing a more involved card game.</p>

                <li>a Musician.
                    <p>When I was young, about 5 or 6 years old, my mother made me study music. I played violin, piano, and guitar. I did enjoy playing instruments, although now I only play piano (and sometimes guitar). Since my piano skills were not completely lost, I've utilized them to create instrumental versions of popular songs and tunes on computer. I can create a decent arrangement, however, it does take a lot of time, and trial and error to do it right.</p>
                    <p>I have a good synth piano at home with full-size weighted keys, and that allows me to practice my skills. I also have created several original pieces, which I may turn into an album at some point. I also can use my own music when coding apps and games, which is a nice bonus.</p>
